Task Summary: Fullstack Intern Assignment 
Project Name: BookIt: Experiences & Slots 
Figma Link:  
Objective: 
Build a complete end-to-end web application where users can explore travel experiences, 
select available slots, and complete bookings. The goal is to test both frontend and backend 
skills, focusing on real-world fullstack workflows, API integration, and clean UI design. 
Requirements 
Frontend 
1. Framework: React + TypeScript (Vite or Next.js recommended) 
2. Styling: TailwindCSS (mandatory) 
3. Pages to Build: 
○ Home Page: List experiences fetched from backend. 
○ Details Page: Show selected experience details, available dates and slots. 
○ Checkout Page: Collect user info, promo code, and display price summary. 
○ Result Page: Display booking confirmation or failure message. 
4. UX/UI Requirements: 
○ Must be responsive and mobile-friendly. 
○ Clean, consistent spacing and typography. 
○ Provide clear feedback (loading, success, failure, sold-out states, etc.). 
5. Frontend Logic: 
○ Consume backend APIs using Axios or Fetch. 
○ Manage state cleanly using React hooks. 
○ Implement minimal form validation (email, name, etc.). 
6. Design Fidelity: 
○ The frontend must match the provided Figma design exactly across desktop, 
mobile breakpoints, including spacing, typography scale, colors, and component 
states. 
Backend 
1. Framework: Node.js with Express or NestJS. 
2. Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB. 
3. API Endpoints (minimum): 
○ GET /experiences - Return list of experiences. 
○ GET /experiences/:id - Return details and slot availability. 
○ POST /bookings - Accept booking details and store them. 
○ POST /promo/validate - Validate promo codes (e.g. SAVE10, FLAT100). 
4. Data Handling: 
○ Store data in the database. 
○ Ensure validation for required fields. 
○ Prevent double-booking for the same slot. 
Integration Flow 
● Frontend should fetch experiences from backend APIs. 
● Full flow should work as: Home → Details → Checkout → Result. 
● Data (like experiences, slots, and booking confirmation) must be dynamic. 
Deliverables 
● Use freely available experience data and royalty-free images (e.g., from Unsplash, 
Pexels, or similar sources) to populate the application. 
● Build a complete working fullstack project covering the entire booking flow from browsing 
to confirmation. 
● The project must be hosted on a cloud platform such as Render, Railway, Vercel, or 
AWS for live review. This is mandatory. 
● Provide a clear and complete README file with setup and run instructions. 
● Submit both the hosted application link and the GitHub repository link.
